2a) Develop a Julia program for the following problem: A computer repair shop
charges $100 per hour for labour plus the cost of any parts used in the repair.
However, the minimum charge for any job is $150. Prompt for the number of
hours worked and the cost of parts and print the charge for the job.

# Function to calculate the repair charge
function calculate_charge(hours_worked, parts_cost)
labor_cost = max(100 * hours_worked, 150) # Ensure minimum charge of
$150
total_cost = labor_cost + parts_cost
return total_cost
end
# Main function
function main()
println("Welcome to the Computer Repair Shop!")
println("Enter the number of hours worked:")
hours_worked = parse(Float64, readline())
println("Enter the cost of parts:")
parts_cost = parse(Float64, readline())
total_charge = calculate_charge(hours_worked, parts_cost)
println("The total charge for the repair job is:", total_charge)
end
# Call the main function
main()
Output

2b) Develop a Julia program to calculate a personâ€™s regular pay, overtime pay and
gross pay bases on the following: if hours worked is less than or equal to
40,regular pay is calculated by multiplying hours worked by rate of pay, and
overtime pay is 0.If hours worked is greater than 40 regular pay is calculated by
multiplying 40 by the rate of pay, and overtime pay is calculated by multiplying
the hours in excess of 40 by the rate of pay by 1.5.Gross pay is calculated by
adding regular pay and overtime pay.

function calculate_pay(hours_worked, rate_of_pay)
regular_pay = 0
overtime_pay = 0
if hours_worked <= 40
regular_pay = hours_worked * rate_of_pay
else
regular_pay = 40 * rate_of_pay
overtime_hours = hours_worked - 40
overtime_pay = overtime_hours * rate_of_pay * 1.5
end
gross_pay = regular_pay + overtime_pay
return regular_pay, overtime_pay, gross_pay
end
# Example usage
hours_worked = 45
rate_of_pay = 10
regular_pay, overtime_pay, gross_pay = calculate_pay(hours_worked,
rate_of_pay)
println("Regular Pay: ", regular_pay)
println("Overtime Pay: ", overtime_pay)
println("Gross Pay: ", gross_pay)
