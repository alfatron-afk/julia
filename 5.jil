5a)Develop a Julia program which reads a string (word) and prints whether the
word is palindrome.

function is_palindrome(word)
n = length(word)
for i in 1:n√∑2
if word[i] != word[n-i+1]
return false
end
end
return true
end
function main()
println("Enter a word:")
word = readline()
if is_palindrome(word)
println("The word is a palindrome.")
else
println("The word is not a palindrome.")
end
end
main()
OUTPUT

5b)Develop a Julia program which reads and prints the words present in a
file(input.txt) having Random Data in which words are dispersed
randomly(Assumption: a word is a contiguous sequence of letters. A word is
delimited by any non-letter character or end-of-line)

function 

read_and_print_words(filename)
 # Open the file for reading
 file = open(filename, "r")
 
 # Initialize a variable to store the 
current word
 current_word = ""
 
 # Loop through each line in the 
file
 for line in eachline(file)
 # Loop through each character 
in the line
 for char in line
 if isletter(char)
 current_word *= char
 else
 if current_word != ""
 println(current_word)
 current_word = ""
 end
 end
 end
 # If line ends with a word, print 
it
 if current_word != ""
 println(current_word)
 current_word = ""
 end
 end
 
 close(file)
end
read_and_print_words("input.txt")
